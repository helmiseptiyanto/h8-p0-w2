Newton Second Law

Algoritma :


		- Identify weight of the car (masa benda dalam satuan kg)

		- Identify acceleration of the car

		- nultiply the weight of the car with acceleration of the car to get the net force of the car.


Pseudocode :


		forumla, f = m * a
		mass = 600kg
		accseleration = 2m /s2
		- multiplay mass by accelertion
		force = mass * accelaration
		force = 600kg * 2
		f = 1200 N
