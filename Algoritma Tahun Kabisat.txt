Tahun kabisat

Algoritma :

	1 Pick the gregorian year you would to identify as leap year (tahun kabisat)
	2. Clarify the leap year by calculate it in the following step :
		- divide the year by 4, if there is remainder of the division then it is not leap year, if there is no remainder then
		- divide the year by 100, if there is remainder of the division then it is leap year, if there is no remainder then
		- divide the year by 400, if there is remainder of the division then it is not leap year, if there is no remainder then it is a leap year


Peseudocode :

	1. OBTAIN the gregorian year
	2. COMPUTE gregorian year by divide it with 4
		  IF 	gregorian year / 4 with remainder THEN
				PRINT "NOT LEAP YEAR"
			ELSE IF gregorian year / 4 without remainder THEN
				COMPUTE gregorian year / 100
					IF gregorian year / 100 with remainder THEN
						PRINT "LEAP YEAR"
						ELSE IF gregorian / 100  without remainder THEN
						 COMPUTE gregorian year / 400
						 IF gregorian year / 400 with remainder THEN
						 PRINT "NOT LEAP YEAR"
						 ELSE PRINT "LEAP YEAR"
