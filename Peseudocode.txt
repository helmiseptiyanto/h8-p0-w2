Algoritma :


		- Identify weight of the car (masa benda dalam satuan kg)

		- Identify acceleration of the car

		- nultiply the weight of the car with acceleration of the car to get the net force of the car.


Pseudocode :


		forumla, f = m * a
		mass = 600kg
		accseleration = 2m /s2
		- multiplay mass by accelertion
		force = mass * accelaration
		force = 600kg * 2
		f = 1200 N

		Tahun kabisat
----------------------------------------

Algoritma :

	1 Pick the gregorian year you would to identify as leap year (tahun kabisat)
	2. Clarify the leap year by calculate it in the following step :
		- divide the year by 4, if there is remainder of the division then it is not leap year, if there is no remainder then
		- divide the year by 100, if there is remainder of the division then it is leap year, if there is no remainder then
		- divide the year by 400, if there is remainder of the division then it is not leap year, if there is no remainder then it is a leap year


Peseudocode :

	1. OBTAIN the gregorian year
	2. COMPUTE gregorian year by divide it with 4
		  IF 	gregorian year / 4 with remainder THEN
				PRINT "NOT LEAP YEAR"
			ELSE IF gregorian year / 4 without remainder THEN
				COMPUTE gregorian year / 100
					IF gregorian year / 100 with remainder THEN
						PRINT "LEAP YEAR"
						ELSE IF gregorian / 100  without remainder THEN
						 COMPUTE gregorian year / 400
						 IF gregorian year / 400 with remainder THEN
						 PRINT "NOT LEAP YEAR"
						 ELSE PRINT "LEAP YEAR"

Algoritma :

 - Prepare the clothes

 - Prepare the washing machine detergent

 - Insert the clothes one by one into the washing machine

 - Insert adequate level of water into washing machine

 - Start the washing machine to wash the clothes

Pseudocode :

 - OBTAIN the clothes

 - GET washing machine detergent

 - FOR clothes = 1 to 20
 	INSERT clothes into washing machine
 	END FOR

 - GET water into washing machine

 - SET washing machine to START

Algoritma :

- Teacher instruct the student to put the student finger on the desk

- Teacher observe the nail of the student one by one per desk

 if the student nail is long then the teacher will punish the student

 if the student nail is not long then the teacher will give compliment to the student

Pseudocode :

- GET the student to put the finger on the desk

- INIT the inspection of the student nail

- FOR student = 1 to 40

 	DETERMINE the length of the student nail

 	IF student nail long THEN

 		INIT punishment to the student

 	ELSE

 		INIT compliment to the student

 	END IF
- END Inspection of the student nail
